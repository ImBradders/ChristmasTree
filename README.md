# Christmas Tree Generator

Christmas tree generator example from lecture in Programming 1 at University of Derby.

## Python

All python code for the project is stored in the python directory. Feel free to open this in any environment you please.

## C#

The c# code is stored in the ChristmasTree folder. To import this into most development environments, you'll need to open your IDE, open a project and then select the .sln file (tested with Visual Studio and Rider).
If you just wish to view the code, you can open the ChristmasTree folder directly in a text editor of your choice.
